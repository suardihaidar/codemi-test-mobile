### Environment Setup

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code.
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `react-native start` to start the packager
- IOS: `react-native run-ios`, Android: `react-native run-android`

#### Directory layout

  - `src` : main container
  - `redux` : for state management
  - `views` : should be a component folder with PascalCase convention, let say you want to create `Login screen` so its folder should like `Login` with `index.js` and `style.js` inside it.
